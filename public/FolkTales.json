    "In a peaceful village surrounded by tall green forests lived a humble woodcutter named Ramu. Every morning before the sun rose, he tied his old axe over his shoulder and walked along the forest path. The birds sang cheerfully, the leaves rustled softly, and the fresh smell of earth welcomed him. Ramu did not have much money, but he worked hard and believed in living an honest life.",
    "One bright morning, Ramu decided to cut wood near the river. The riverbank was beautiful, with sparkling water flowing gently between smooth stones. He found a large tree and began chopping its trunk with steady swings of his iron axe. While he was working, his foot slipped on a mossy rock. His hands lost grip, and suddenly the axe flew out of his hand and fell into the deep river with a loud splash.",
    "Ramu panicked. That axe was his only tool, the only way he earned his living. He knelt at the edge of the river and tried reaching into the water, but the river was far too deep. He moved along the bank, searching desperately, but the river swallowed everything in silence. Exhausted, he sat on a rock, held his head in his hands, and cried, thinking, 'How will I feed my family now? What will I do tomorrow?'",
    "As the river flowed quietly, a golden light suddenly shimmered on the surface. The water rose gently like a wave, and from it emerged a beautiful fairy. She wore a flowing white dress, her hair shone like silver, and her voice was soft as the wind. 'Good man, why do you cry by the river?' she asked kindly. Surprised but hopeful, Ramu explained everything honestly and sorrowfully.",
    "The fairy nodded with understanding. She dipped her hand into the water and lifted a shining golden axe. The axe glowed in the sunlight like a beam of pure gold. She asked, 'Is this your axe, good man?' Ramu looked at the golden axe with wide eyes but shook his head. 'No, that is not mine. I cannot own something so precious.'",
    "The fairy smiled gently and again disappeared beneath the water. This time she rose holding a beautiful silver axe that sparkled softly. 'Is this one yours?' she asked. Ramu admired the silver axe but answered truthfully once again. 'No, ma'am. That is not mine either. My axe was simple and old.'",
    "The fairy disappeared a third time and emerged holding a rusty iron axe exactly like Ramu's. Ramu's face lit up with joy. 'Yes! That is my axe! Thank you so much!' He reached out with trembling hands, grateful beyond words.",
    "The fairy smiled brightly, pleased with his honesty. 'You were truthful even when you had the chance to claim wealth that was not yours,' she said. 'For your honesty, you deserve a reward.' She placed all three axes in his hands the golden one, the silver one, and his iron one. Ramu could barely believe his eyes. He bowed gratefully and thanked her again and again.",
    "Ramu returned to the village with his axes. His family was overjoyed, and the villagers were surprised. When they heard the story, some greedy men hurried to the river, pretending to drop their axes and crying loudly to attract the fairy. When she appeared and offered the golden axe, they quickly lied and claimed it was theirs. But the fairy knew their greed and vanished, taking even their real axes with her.",
    "From that day onwards, Ramu lived comfortably. He used the golden and silver axes wisely, never wasting their value, and he continued working with his iron axe, remaining the same honest man he always was. His story spread far and wide, reminding everyone that honesty brings blessings in the most unexpected ways."

    "One scorching summer, the sun burned fiercely, drying ponds and shrinking rivers. Animals wandered endlessly searching for water, but every pond they visited was nothing but cracked mud. Fear and worry spread among the creatures, and the jungle grew silent as thirst took over.",
    "One day, several young elephants ran to Gajaraj. 'We can't find even a drop of water,' they said. 'The calves are crying, and the animals are restless. What should we do?' Gajaraj closed his eyes, recalling places he had visited years ago. After a moment, he said, 'There is an ancient waterhole hidden deep inside the forest. It has never dried up. Follow me, and I will lead you there.'",
    "The journey was long. The sun was harsh, and the path was filled with thorny bushes. Many animals joined the group as they walked, trusting the old elephant's wisdom. Monkeys climbed trees scanning for signs of water, deer walked silently, and birds circled overhead, all hoping Gajaraj was right.",
    "At last, they reached a small hill covered in thick vines. Gajaraj remembered this place from his youth. With a gentle push of his head, he cleared the vines, revealing a hidden opening leading down into the earth. The animals followed him inside. The air turned cooler, and soon they heard the faint, sweet sound of trickling water.",
    "At the bottom of the cavern lay a glowing underground lake—clear, fresh, and untouched. The moment the animals saw it, their eyes filled with relief and joy. They rushed to drink, the calves splashed in the cool water, and birds dipped their wings.",
    "Just then, a loud roar echoed from above. A pack of hungry predators—tigers and wild dogs—had followed them. Panic broke among the animals. Gajaraj stepped forward, raising his trunk. 'Everyone stay behind me,' he commanded.",
    "The predators hesitated, not expecting an old elephant to stand so fiercely. Gajaraj pounded the ground with his massive feet, causing the cave walls to vibrate. Dust fell from above, and the narrow pathway trembled. Seeing his courage and determination, the predators slowly backed away, realizing the old elephant would fight until his last breath.",
    "When the danger passed, the animals surrounded Gajaraj with gratitude. They drank peacefully, finally free from fear. Gajaraj watched them with a soft smile. He knew his duty was fulfilled.",

    "In an old town filled with narrow streets and colorful bazaars lived an elderly clockmaker named Samarth. He repaired everything from tiny pocket watches to giant tower clocks. People said his hands worked with the precision of magic.",
    "Over the years, Samarth became so busy fixing clocks that he forgot the meaning of time itself. He worked from dawn to dusk, never meeting friends, never resting, never smiling. His shop was filled with ticking sounds but empty of laughter.",
    "One afternoon, a little girl named Mira entered the shop. She held a small wooden clock shaped like a bird. 'Can you fix its chirp?' she asked softly.",
    "Samarth examined it. The clock was old and cracked. He repaired its gears, polished its wings, and gently wound its spring. When he finished, the clock chirped sweetly. Mira clapped with joy.",
    "Before leaving, she asked, 'Uncle, you fix everyone's time. But what about your own time? Do you ever enjoy a moment?' Her innocent question struck Samarth’s heart.",
    "That evening, he closed his shop early for the first time in years. He walked through the town square, watching children play and elders chat. He noticed colors, life, and smiles he had long forgotten.",
    "As he walked, he reached the old clock tower he had repaired many times. Suddenly it struck the hour, echoing across the town. The sound felt different. It felt alive.",
    "Samarth realized that time was not meant to be measured only by gears and springs. Time was meant to be lived. He returned home, prepared a warm meal, and sat peacefully by the window, watching the sunset paint the sky.",
    "From the next day, Samarth changed his routine. He still repaired clocks, but he also took time to laugh, rest, and enjoy life. His customers noticed the warmth in his voice and the calm in his smile.",
    "The clockmaker who once fixed only machines now helped people remember something more important: to cherish the moments that time brings."

    "On the edge of the snowy Himalayas lived a young shepherd named Neel. Every morning he led his flock of sheep up the hills to graze. The mountains were cold but beautiful, with shining glaciers and mist floating like clouds at his feet. Neel loved the mountains more than anyone else in the village.",
    "One day, while following a stray lamb, Neel slipped and tumbled through a bush, discovering a narrow passage hidden behind thick vines. Curious, he stepped inside. To his shock, the passage opened into a breathtaking valley filled with green grass, colorful flowers, and warm sunlight. The air smelled sweet, and a gentle stream flowed through the valley.",
    "Neel’s sheep happily ran around, nibbling the fresh grass. Neel sat under a flowering tree, amazed. He had found a paradise unknown to anyone else. For weeks, he returned secretly, letting his flock graze there and keeping the valley hidden from everyone.",

Neel remembered the secret valley, but he hesitated. If he told the villagers, they might destroy its beauty. If he stayed silent, people and animals would suffer.",
    "That night he couldn’t sleep. His heart struggled between protecting a secret and saving lives. The next morning, he gathered the villagers and told them about the valley. They followed him through the narrow passage, their hearts beating with hope.",

    "Seeing their joy, Neel felt at peace. The villagers thanked him and decided to protect the valley together. They made rules: no cutting trees, no polluting the stream, no fighting for land. They worked as one family.",
    "Under Neel’s guidance, the valley stayed fertile through the entire drought. People survived, animals thrived, and the secret valley became a shared treasure.",
    "Many years later, Neel grew old, but everyone remembered him as the shepherd who saved the village not with strength, but with kindness and courage.",
    "The valley remains protected even today, a symbol of trust, unity, and the power of doing what is right."
